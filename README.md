# COLLEGE-NETWORK-DESIGN-AND-IMPLEMENTATION

This case study examines the design and deployment of a comprehensive business 
system network to support the expansion of a trading floor support center into a new 
facility. The project, implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer, aims to create a scalable, 
robust, and future-ready network infrastructure that accommodates current needs while 
preparing for future growth. A hierarchical model forms the foundation of the network, 
with redundancy integrated at every layer to ensure reliability and resilience. 
To achieve uninterrupted connectivity, the network design includes dual Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs), which protect against internet outages, and wireless networks 
established for each department to support flexible access. Additionally, the network 
segregates different departments through the use of VLANs and subnets, ensuring 
optimized traffic flow and security. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is employed as 
the primary routing protocol, facilitating efficient data routing across the network. 
Configuration highlights include DHCP servers for dynamic IP address allocation, 
static IP addresses for key devices, Secure Shell (SSH) for secure network 
management, and Port Address Translation (PAT) for efficient management of 
outbound traffic. Rigorous testing and verification procedures are underscored to 
ensure that the network functions seamlessly under various conditions and supports the 
organizationâ€™s goals for security, scalability, and adaptability. This case study provides 
a valuable framework for deploying resilient and efficient network solutions that 
support long-term business objectives. [CN REPORT MATHESH.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19123134/CN.REPORT.MATHESH.pdf)
